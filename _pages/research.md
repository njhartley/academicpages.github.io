My research includes a variety of topics under the broad heading of 'High Energy Density Physics'. Specific areas include:

Shock-Compression of Light Elements
======

This work aims to study materials at conditions similar to those present inside giant planets. This is achieved by using a large laser system to shock the target, which both heats and compresses it to the relevant condition, then probing it using X-rays. The best results come from X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) facilities such as [LCLS](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) or [SACLA](http://xfel.riken.jp/eng/), which can deliver extremely bright pulses on incredibly short timescales.


Ultrafast X-ray Heating
======

Due to their intensity, the same pulses that are used to probe samples above can themselves be used to heat samples. 

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
