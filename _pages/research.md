My research includes a variety of topics under the broad heading of 'High Energy Density Physics'. Specific areas include:

Shock-Compression of Light Elements
======

This work aims to study materials at conditions similar to those present inside giant planets. This is achieved by using a large laser system to shock the target, which both heats and compresses it to the relevant condition, then probing it using X-rays. The best results come from X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) facilities such as [LCLS](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) or [SACLA](http://xfel.riken.jp/eng/), which can deliver extremely bright pulses on incredibly short timescales.

Ultrafast X-ray Heating
======

Due to their intensity, the same pulses that are used to probe samples above can themselves be used to heat samples. Unlike most heating methods, using laser or particle irradiation, this is both very fast, limited only by the duration of the pulse, and heats all the way through the target. By using high energy X-rays, materials go from ambient conditions to highly ionized within only a few tens of femtoseconds, giving the ions no time to equilibrate. The subsequent evolution is almost impossible to predict using current methods, and we are working on understanding it better.
