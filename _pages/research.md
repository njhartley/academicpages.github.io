My research includes a variety of topics under the broad heading of 'High Energy Density Physics'. Specific areas include:

Shock-Compression of Light Elements
======

This work aims to study materials at conditions similar to those present inside giant planets. This is achieved by using a large laser system to shock the target, which both heats and compresses it to the relevant condition, then probing it using X-rays. The best results come from X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) facilities such as [LCLS](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) or [SACLA](http://xfel.riken.jp/eng/), which can deliver extremely bright pulses on incredibly short timescales.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's fcontent without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Ultrafast X-ray Heating
======

Due to their intensity, the same pulses that are used to probe samples above can themselves be used to heat samples. 

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
