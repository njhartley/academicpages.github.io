Education
======
* MSci <span>Physics with Theoretical Physics</span>, **Imperial College London**, 2010.
* PGCE <span>Science (Physics)</span>, **Institute of Education**, 2011.
* DPhil <span> Atomic and Laser Physics </span> **University of Oxford**, 2014.

Research experience
======
* July 2016 - Present : Postdoctoral Researcher ([HZDR]( https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0 ))
	* Specializing in X-ray probing of heated and compressed matter
	* Directing the analysis of data from two LCLS runs looking at demixing of hydrocarbons into liquid and diamond at planetary interior conditions
	* Published two papers on the work as first author, including a comparison of the liquid structure data with first principles simulations in PRL
	* Led beamtimes at SACLA as PI, looking at the effects of atomic strucure on sample evolution after direct heating X-ray lasers
	
* Feb 2015 - Present: Specially Appointed Assistant Professor ([Osaka University]( https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en ))
	* Specializing in shock-compressed matter
	* Directed experimental shifts as part of a campaign on the SACLA XFEL facility using x-rays to probe laser-shock-compressed materials
	* Published a paper on ultrafast laser-matter interaction probed by XFEL diffraction, as well as contributing to analysis for several other publications
	* Awarded  Â¥3M over 3 years through Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists, for research on warm dense carbon

* Feb 2012 - Jun 2015: DPhil Atomic and Laser Physics ([University of Oxford]( http://www.ox.ac.uk/ ))
	* Specializing in laser-solid interactions and warm dense matter research
	* Led a multinational team in carrying out a 5-week experiment on the Titan laser facility, LLNL, probing temperature relaxation in proton-heated tantalum
	* Analyzed X-ray diffraction (image plate), proton spectrometry and optical pyrometry data, with a paper on the results published in HEDP 
	* ll{Participated in some of the first experiments at LCLS, using diffraction and ultrahigh resolution scattering to probe laser shock compressed samples
  
Practical Skills
======

* **XRD**: Used X-ray diffraction with ordered (crysalline) and amorphous (plastic) samples, looking at changes in material properties and the formation of new structures under shock compression and heating; previously used diffraction as an ion temperature diagnostic in experiments at Titan and Phelix
* **XRTS**: Carried out analysis of XRTS data from LCLS experiments, including spatially- and energy-resolved spectra; looked at characteristic state features in data on an experiment studying high pressure phase transitions
* **Analysis/Modelling**: Modelled and analyzed data using techniques such as radiation hydrodynamics, XRTS codes, molecular dynamics and density functional theory as well as home-built simulations and codes
* **Optical**: Installed Visar and streaked optical pyrometry diagnostics at the SACLA XFEL facility; previously deployed an SOP on the Titan laser for electron temperature diagnosis
* **Management**: & Led multiple beamtimes as PI at SACLA, worked as co-PI for an LCLS beamtime and ran an experiment at the Titan laser facility
