\section{Practical Experience}

* **XRD**: Used X-ray diffraction with ordered (crysalline) and amorphous (plastic) samples, looking at changes in material properties and the formation of new structures under shock compression and heating; previously used diffraction as an ion temperature diagnostic in experiments at Titan and Phelix
* **XRTS**: Carried out analysis of XRTS data from LCLS experiments, including spatially- and energy-resolved spectra; looked at characteristic state features in data on an experiment studying high pressure phase transitions
* **Analysis/Modelling: Modelled and analyzed data using techniques such as radiation hydrodynamics, XRTS codes, molecular dynamics and density functional theory as well as home-built simulations and codes
* **Optical**: Installed Visar and streaked optical pyrometry diagnostics at the SACLA XFEL facility; previously deployed an SOP on the Titan laser for electron temperature diagnosis
* **Management**: & Led multiple beamtimes as PI at SACLA, worked as co-PI for an LCLS beamtime and ran an experiment at the Titan laser facility
